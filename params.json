As a result, it's too difficult\r\nto extend cable length in a reliable way with reasonable cost. But this addon\r\nmake it possible to use Kinect remotely. Kinect is connected to a server PC via\r\nUSB. The server runs a service program to pass the Kinect data to a client PC\r\nvia TCP/IP. LAN is easy to use in the distance. Of couse, you can use it via\r\nWifi network. Also you can use it via the internet with acceptable latency.\r\n\r\nDependency\r\n----------\r\nofxRemoteKinect depends on some other addons.\r\n\r\n+ [ofxZmq](https://github.com/satoruhiga/ofxZmq)\r\n    commit affab2a0ff02f660042e08b75e318fa4cdb4bb4d\r\n+ [ofxKinect](https://github.com/ofTheo/ofxKinect)\r\n    commit eb06686cbc5d38a07fcf24817ad9e73031f6a4b7\r\n+ [ofxControlPanel](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxControlPanel)\r\n    commit 98697f40b0dfa423689d9360d04cfb026de5d7c8\r\n+ ofxXmlSettings openFrameworks 0073 includes\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nTo use ofxRemoteKinect, checkout this repositry in addition to openFrameworks\r\nand dependent addons.\r\n\r\n````\r\ngit clone https://github.com/toyoshim/ofxRemoteKinect.git\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe addon should sit in `openFrameworks/addons/ofxRemoteKinect/`.\r\n\r\nExample Projects\r\n----------------\r\nTwo example projects exists in the `example` folder.\r\n\r\n### remoteKinectServer\r\nThis is a reference server implementation. You may want to use it as is. If you\r\nwant to listen at different ports, you can change it by editing port numbers\r\nin main.cpp.\r\n\r\n### remoteKinectClient\r\nThis is an example client. Also you can change the server address by editing\r\nserver and port description written in main.cpp.\r\n\r\nThis example use ofxRemoteKinectClient class to control kinect configurations\r\nand get the latest screen information. This class provide functions to control\r\nnear and far clipping parameters for depth information, tilt angle, and JPEG\r\ncompression quality which is used to transfer screen information. Also it\r\nprovide remote kinect screen information as ofTexture, ofPixels, and direct\r\npointers to buffer memories as ofxKinect does.\r\n","google":"","tagline":"Let's control your kinect via network"}
