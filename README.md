Description
-----------
ofxRemoteKinect is an openFrameworks addon for using Xbox Kinect via network.

Usually, Kinect is connected to the PC via USB. As a result, it's too difficult
to extend cable length in a reliable way with reasonable cost. But this addon
make it possible to use Kinect remotely. Kinect is connected to a server PC via
USB. The server runs a service program to pass the Kinect data to a client PC
via TCP/IP. LAN is easy to use in the distance. Of couse, you can use it via
Wifi network. Also you can use it via the internet with acceptable latency.

Dependency
----------
ofxRemoteKinect depends on some other addons.
